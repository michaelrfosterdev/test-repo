> "I fear not the demons wielding spears of hellfire, nor the fey spiriting away our soldiers in the night. I fear not the divine power scorching through this blade, nor the radiance which threatens to subsume my mind. No. I fear the bottomless malice that roils within the hearts of mortal men. And I fear that in banishing these enemies to hell, we damn ourselves to one of our own making."

# The Syrillian Calendar

Although many cultures throughout [[The World/Dor'Balar\|Dor'Balar]] have developed a calendars, the [[Syrillian Calendar\|Syrillian Calendar]]—established at the end of the [[The Ages/Second Age\|Second Age]]—is the primary calendar used today. The [[Syrillian Calendar\|Syrillian Calendar]] begins at year 1 with the signing of the [[Syrillian Covenant\|Syrillian Covenant]], all years following this event being denoted ASC (After the Syrillian Covenant), and all years prior increment in reverse and are denoted using BSC (Before the Syrillian Covenant).
# [[The Ages/First Age\|The First Age]] (unknown - ~1800 BSC)

## An unknown history

Not much is known about the [[The Ages/First Age\|First Age]]. Scripture describes this period as the "Age of Shadow", a time where demons and fey ruled over the [[Mortal Races/Mortal Races\|mortal races]] with absolute power and abject cruelty. Only with the power of the six [[The World/Divine Aspects\|Divine Aspects]] and their magical weapons were mortals able to depose the tyrants and take their place as the rightful rulers of [[The World/Dor'Balar\|Dor'Balar]].

The [[The Ages/First Age\|First Age]] ended sometime ~1800 BSC when the last demon was excised from [[The World/Dor'Balar\|Dor'Balar]] and sent back to their home dimension of [[The World/Dor'Daedeloth\|Dor'Daedeloth]].
# [[The Ages/Second Age\|The Second Age]] (~1800 BSC - 1 BSC)

## An age of chaos

Specific events from this period are difficult to place, largely because scholarship into the [[The Ages/Second Age\|Second Age]] was strictly monopolized by Elves of the [[The Ages/Third Age\|Third Age]] [[Nations/Linthirian Empire\|Linthirian Empire]]. However, efforts by the [[Church of the Divine Aspects\|Church of the Divine Aspects]] and scholars of the [[The Ages/Current Age\|Current Age]] have produced the following information as public knowledge:

The [[The Ages/Second Age\|Second Age]], or the "Age of Chaos", saw the rise of two opposing factions: the [[Draconic Dynasty\|Draconic Dynasty]] and the [[Kingdom of Giants\|Kingdom of Giants]]. Having excised the demons and fey keeping these two powers in check, the [[Mortal Races/Mortal Races\|mortal races]] and the lands of [[The World/Dor'Balar\|Dor'Balar]] were soon claimed by these empires. The [[Mortal Races/Mortal Races\|mortal races]] were sent as pawns to fight in an endless series of skirmishes between the two kingdoms, each vying for control of the continent. This period also saw the creation of the [[Mortal Races/Goliaths\|Goliaths]] and [[Mortal Races/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]] from their respective empires, all in the effort to man their increasingly deadly wars. In an attempt to improve mortal efficacy, the [[Draconic Dynasty\|Draconic Dynasty]] and the [[Kingdom of Giants\|Kingdom of Giants]] allowed their subjects to organize into self-governing vassal-states, a move that would ultimately prove their downfall.
## [[Syrillian Alliance\|The Syrillian Alliance]]

After years of struggle under under yet more tyrannical rule, the mortal nations of [[The World/Dor'Balar\|Dor'Balar]] banded together once more to strike out against the [[Kingdom of Giants\|Kingdom of Giants]] and [[Draconic Dynasty\|Draconic Dynasty]], forming the [[Syrillian Alliance\|Syrillian Alliance]]. With guidance from the [[The World/Divine Aspects\|Divine Aspects]], the [[Syrillian Alliance\|Syrillian Alliance]] crafted powerful magic artifacts capable of thwarting their would-be rulers; and using these weapons, the [[Mortal Races/Mortal Races\|mortal races]] toppled the empires of dragons and giants, emancipating those under their rule.

After the last draconic stronghold fell, the mortal nations of the [[Syrillian Alliance\|Syrillian Alliance]] convened for one final time. At this congress, the mortal nations drafted the [[Syrillian Covenant\|Syrillian Covenant]], a document which divided land, solidified alliances, and set rules of governance such that no nation would hold such tyrannical dominion over mortals ever again. Additionally, the magical artifacts—created for annihilating their giant/draconic foes—were deemed too dangerous for an age of peace. So, the mortal nations agreed to destroy the knowledge of their creation and hide away the artifacts until the time they would be needed again—a time they prayed would never come to pass.

Dragons and giants still exist in [[The World/Dor'Balar\|Dor'Balar]], but now hide away in remote mountain caves or unreachable cloud-floating castles.  
# The Third Age: (1 ASC - 3298 ASC)

## A period of peace

Records of this age are relatively common, due largely to preservation efforts of the mortal nations of [[The World/Dor'Balar\|Dor'Balar]] following the [[Syrillian Covenant\|Syrillian Covenant]], and later the scholars of the [[Nations/Linthirian Empire\|Linthirian Empire]]. However, some today debate the accuracy of these events, as even the Elves—with their millennium-long lifespan—could have twisted the history over their ~3000 year reign. 

For three centuries following the signing of the [[Syrillian Covenant\|Syrillian Covenant]], the newly minted mortal nations enjoyed a period of deserved peace. The people of [[The World/Dor'Balar\|Dor'Balar]] were finally afforded time to heal from the past millennia of subjugation; however, this was not to last.

It began with land disputes between the shorter-lived races. As generations came and went, the cultures of most mortal nations slowly shifted, and they began losing the ideals outlined in the [[Syrillian Covenant\|Syrillian Covenant]]. By 400 ASC, all but the Elves and Dwarves had forgotten the true cost of tyranny; and as skirmishes evolved to battles evolved to wars, the Elves grew anxious. 

After, in 427 ASC, Human forces decimated their Orcish enemies at the [[Battle of White Mound\|Battle of White Mound]] using the recently unearthed [[Staff of Maggots\|Staff of Maggots]]—a [[The Ages/Second Age\|Second Age]] artifact of potent necromantic power—the [[Nations/Linthirian Empire\|Linthirian Kingdom]] felt the need to act. 
## [[Nations/Linthirian Empire\|The Linthirian Empire]]

Fearing the power of these [[The Ages/Second Age\|Second Age]] artifacts and the increasingly militant mortal nations, the [[Nations/Linthirian Empire\|Linthirian Kingdom]] pleaded with their patron deity [[Kethryllia\|Kethryllia]], goddess of magic, for the power to protect [[The World/Dor'Balar\|Dor'Balar]]. [[Kethryllia\|Kethryllia]] granted their request, bestowing upon the Elves arcane might never before channeled by mortals. Using this power, the Elves struck out against the warring mortal nations and brought them to submission. Within 7 short years, all remaining lands of [[The World/Dor'Balar\|Dor'Balar]] were brought under the wing of the newly minted [[Nations/Linthirian Empire\|Linthirian Empire]].

Despite the violent start, for a while life under the [[Nations/Linthirian Empire\|Linthirian Empire]] was in many ways reminiscent of the first decades of the [[The Ages/Third Age\|Third Age]]. Trade grew common, the arts flourished, and the [[Nations/Linthirian Empire\|Empire]] largely lived up to the [[Syrillian Covenant\|Syrillian]] ideals that had initially led the Linthirian [[Council of Elves\|Council of Elves]] to act. However, despite their extended lifespans, Elves are not immortal.

As Elves aged out of their Council and generations passed, they too forgot the cost of tyranny. After 750 years of Linthirian rule, the [[Council of Elves\|Council of Elves]] had restricted access to their magical city of [[Cities and Towns/Linthir'Aprimos\|Linthir'Aprimos]] to exclusively Elves. After 600 years more, the [[Nations/Linthirian Empire\|Linthirian Empire]] demanded tithe from her vassals. By the year 2300 ASC, having stewed in absolute power for several generations, the [[Nations/Linthirian Empire\|Linthirian Empire]] had become exactly the monster they feared all that time ago. Several rebellions flared during this period, each one snuffed out at one point or another. The major point of failure for these war bands was the impenetrable magical fortress of [[Cities and Towns/Linthir'Aprimos\|Linthir'Aprimos]]; after centuries on centuries of building magical wards and defenses, the Elves of [[Cities and Towns/Linthir'Aprimos\|Linthir'Aprimos]] could withstand any assault and fire back with arcane powers so potent, it would crushed the morale of any rebellion poised against them. Life under tyranny continued this way for some time: rebellion and submission, rebellion and submission, rebellion and submission. That was, of course, until the legendary [[Rebellion of All Kinds\|Rebellion of All Kinds]].
## [[Rebellion of All Kinds\|The Rebellion of All Kinds]]

It began as a simple Dwarven uprising in 3277 ASC, the belligerents having smuggled enough iron out of the [[Peaks of Kherggom\|Kherggom]] mines to craft a small militia's worth of weapons. However, as the Elves defensively cloistered in [[Cities and Towns/Linthir'Aprimos\|Linthir'Aprimos]], the Dwarves expanded west seek the aid of the other [[Mortal Races/Mortal Races\|mortal races]]. After a campaign of liberating various cities and systematically recruiting races from around [[The World/Dor'Balar\|Dor'Balar]], the [[Rebellion of All Kinds\|Rebellion of All Kinds]] had grown sizable, but still impotent against the impenetrable stronghold of [[Cities and Towns/Linthir'Aprimos\|Linthir'Aprimos]].

That was until a band of heroes, comprised of members from all oppressed races, set out in search of a power to breach the Elven defenses: these were the [[Heroes of the Hawk\|Heroes of the Hawk]], and they sought the power of a [[The Ages/First Age\|First Age]] artifact. After a years-long journey, facing Linthirian legions through [[The World/Dor'Balar\|Dor'Balar]] and armies of the damned through [[The World/Dor'Daedeloth\|Dor'Daedeloth]], the [[Heroes of the Hawk\|Heroes of the Hawk]] finally acquired that for which they'd been searching: [[Magic Items/Dor'Hathalidir\|Dor'Hathalidir]], the [[The Ages/First Age\|First Age]] Earth-Rending Blade.  

With the power of [[Magic Items/Dor'Hathalidir\|Dor'Hathalidir]], the [[Heroes of the Hawk\|Heroes of the Hawk]] and the armies of the [[Rebellion of All Kinds\|Rebellion of All Kinds]] marched to [[Cities and Towns/Linthir'Aprimos\|Linthir'Aprimos]]. Bards of the [[The Ages/Current Age\|Current Age]] describe how the Heroes cleaved through the wards and defenses of this impenetrable city, shearing the land itself and cutting off  [[Cities and Towns/Linthir'Aprimos\|Linthir'Aprimos]] from the rest of the continent. However, despite the awe-inspiring power of their [[The Ages/First Age\|First Age]] weapon, the wards of [[Cities and Towns/Linthir'Aprimos\|Linthir'Aprimos]]—cast consistently for millennia by this point—quickly began to self-assemble. In the minutes the barrier was disabled, the [[Heroes of the Hawk\|Heroes of the Hawk]] and the frontline ranks of the [[Rebellion of All Kinds\|Rebellion of All Kinds]] charged the streets of the Elven city, cutting through endless waves of magical Elf platoons.

As the great wards of [[Cities and Towns/Linthir'Aprimos\|Linthir'Aprimos]] closed, the brave souls who entered the city would never again see the land they fought so valiantly to protect. We can only speculate as to what exactly transpired inside the Elven city, but what we do know is that by the dawn of the following morning, [[Kethryllia\|Kethryllia]]—goddess of Magic and Elves—was dead, and the war was won. 
# The Current Age: (3298 ASC - 3713 ASC current)

## Elves of the [[The Ages/Current Age\|Current Age]]

A number of Elves survived the fall of [[Cities and Towns/Linthir'Aprimos\|Linthir'Aprimos]], either by fleeing in those brief minutes the barrier was down, or by being lucky enough to have been away from the city at the time. However, following the death of their patron deity, the surviving Elves had their potent magic violently stripped from them, leaving them physically scarred and as powerless as the races who bested them. And, although this would only be discovered in the following decades, the Elves were now all-but unable to produce offspring, with conception between two Elves now being extraordinarily rare. Perhaps as karmic punishment, Elves now roam [[The World/Dor'Balar\|Dor'Balar]] as a doomed people, watching as their numbers dwindle century by century even as the other races slowly forget the sins of the [[Nations/Linthirian Empire\|Linthirian Empire]].
## Fractured States Period

After the fall of [[Cities and Towns/Linthir'Aprimos\|Linthir'Aprimos]], there again occurred a period of peace for the remaining city-states of the rebellion lasting ~200 years. Borders were established, and the people of [[The World/Dor'Balar\|Dor'Balar]] were once again afforded a moment to breathe. 

This period of peace, however, was never meant to last. And as generations pass and the city-states of [[The World/Dor'Balar\|Dor'Balar]] grew more independent and more bold; the Dwarves of [[Cities and Towns/Anbuur/Khazâddun\|Khazâddun]] first invaded the Dragonborn settlements to the south, but quickly moved to claim the surrounding Smallfolk and Orcish states in the surrounding area. The city-states in the west, fearing the encroaching Dwarven forces, clamored to solidify their power. Standing out among them, the human city-state of [[Cities and Towns/Jkaverstelle/Kithraia\|Kithraia]] slowly consolidated power throughout west [[The World/Dor'Balar\|Dor'Balar]]; through a series of military campaigns and diplomatic agreements, [[Cities and Towns/Jkaverstelle/Kithraia\|Kithraia]] annexed the remaining city states, forming the Kingdom of [[Nations/Jkaverstelle\|Jkaverstelle]] and her [[Nations/Jkaverstelle\|Great Houses of Jkaverstelle]]. In the same time, soldiers of [[Cities and Towns/Anbuur/Khazâddun\|Khazâddun]] conquered the eastern lands of [[The World/Dor'Balar\|Dor'Balar]], establishing the nation of [[Nations/Anbuur\|Anbuur]].
## Where are we now?

It's been 75 years since the last of the [[Nations/Jkaverstelle\|Great Houses of Jkaverstelle]] joined the Kingdom. And for most of that, the nations of [[Nations/Anbuur\|Anbuur]] and [[Nations/Jkaverstelle\|Jkaverstelle]] and the peoples of [[The World/Dor'Balar\|Dor'Balar]] have enjoyed relative peace. In the last 10 years however, a number of aggressive moves from both nations have seen military tension and anxieties rise throughout the continent. At the same time, cult sightings and evidence of demonic activity have been on the rise, and despite efforts to investigate, no one can identify the cause.
