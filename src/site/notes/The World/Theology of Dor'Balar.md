# The Afterlife

According to church doctrine, when a member of a mortal race dies, their soul is claimed by whichever [[The World/Divine Aspects\|Divine Aspect]] most aligns with their ideals, character, and moral code. Even an individual with no outstanding qualities can rely on their patron deity to ferry their soul to a restful afterlife; in this way, the [[The World/Divine Aspects\|Divine Aspects]] are quite forgiving. However, in the event that a person is vile in all aspects such that no god is willing to claim them in death, their soul is instead taken by the dark legions of [[The World/Dor'Daedeloth\|Dor'Daedeloth]] where they're said to be tortured for all eternity. 
# The [[Church of the Divine Aspects\|Church of the Divine Aspects]]

The central religious institution of [[The World/Dor'Balar\|Dor'Balar]] is the [[Church of the Divine Aspects\|Church of the Divine Aspects]]. Headquartered in [[Cities and Towns/Anbuur/Khazâddun\|Khazâddun's]] [[Cathedral of Thrüldagehr\|Cathedral of Thrüldagehr]], the Church is responsible for regulating worship and providing funds for smaller churches throughout the continent. Although not a governing body in itself, the Church's affiliation with [[Cities and Towns/Anbuur/Khazâddun\|Khazâddun]] affords them undeniable political sway in [[Nations/Anbuur\|Anbuur]], which they've used to solidify their city as the primary religious destination on [[The World/Dor'Balar\|Dor'Balar]]. In recent years, the Church's main concern has been the unexplained uptick in cult activity, offering sizable bounties for any tangible information on occult activity in the continent.
