> "When the drinking age of any patron is in question, please consult the most up-to-date copy of the *Linthirian Code of Legal Standards*, section XII, subsection xvii, for a grid detailing the ages of maturity for all mortal races and their signifiers. Failure to comply to current drinking standards will result in a liquor license revocation for any offending establishment, with the submission of appeals to occur no earlier than 6 months post-offense. Glory to the Empire."

In [[The World/Dor'Balar\|Dor'Balar]], "Mortal Races" are another word for Humanoid. Though in the history, the "mortal races" were those present during the signing of the [[Syrillian Covenant\|Syrillian Covenant]]. 

> [!NOTE] Other Races
> I added the races I could think of that immediately made sense with the lore of [[The World/Dor'Balar\|Dor'Balar]], but if anyone wants to play a race that's not currently on this list. Work with me and we can absolutely add them to the history. 

# Common Species

## [[Mortal Races/Humans\|Humans]]

- Patron god [[Jvesgar\|Jvesgar]], god of pleasure. Giving them the ability to produce offspring with all mortal races.
- Close ties with [[Half-folk\|Half-folk]] sharing their human blood.
- Naming conventions: often eastern-European, or just regular human names. 
## [[Mortal Races/Dwarves\|Dwarves]]

- Patron god [[The World/Divine Aspects/Gudmunhil\|Gudmunhil]], god of the moon.
- Talented ironworkers and miners.
- Only a few generations have passed for them since the fall of the [[Nations/Linthirian Empire\|Linthirian Empire]], so anti-elf sentiments are strongest with the Dwarves.
- Naming conventions: A lot of double-consonants, some umlauts for flavor, and that carrot above vowels. Last names can often be nordic, or a combination of multiple mineral/mining terms. E.g., [[Thjorvidson\|Thjorvidson]], Broadiron
## [[Smallfolk\|Smallfolk]]

- Patron goddess [[The World/Divine Aspects/Ignomer\|Ignomer]], goddess of nature
- Both Gnomes and Halflings are sub-races of Smallfolk
- Connection w/ nature and idyllic living, think Hobbits, (though that's somewhat reductive).
- Naming conventions: Last names usually just a combination of two natural stuff. E.g., [[Rosewood\|Rosewood]].
## [[Orcs\|Orcs]]

- Patron goddess [[The World/Divine Aspects/Urglan\|Urglan]], goddess of war
- They value strength, directness, loyalty
- Naming conventions: Names are heavy on the consonants and series of simple sharp phrases. Hyphens are often common with Orc names and places. E.g., [[Urthgar Vra-Eklund\|Urthgar Vra-Eklund]], [[Cities and Towns/Jkaverstelle/Dru-Karmaz/Dru-Karmaz\|Dru-Karmaz]].
# Uncommon Species

## [[Elves\|Elves]]

- Following the death of their patron god [[Kethryllia\|Kethryllia]] at the end of the [[The Ages/Third Age\|Third Age]], the birth of Elven children is extraordinarily rare.
- They are a race that has slowly been dying out since the end of the [[The Ages/Third Age\|Third Age]] ~500 years ago.
- Almost all Elves today were alive at the end of the [[The Ages/Third Age\|Third Age]] and witnessed the fall of the [[Nations/Linthirian Empire\|Linthirian Empire]]. Most were likely complicit in its tyranny. 
- Naming conventions: Names are typically pretty euphonic with a lot of "i" sounds. Very much LOTR elves. Common to have apostrophes in names. E.g., [[Cities and Towns/Linthir'Aprimos\|Linthir'Aprimos]], Syrillian.
## [[Eladrin\|Eladrin]]

- No patron deity, but tend to worship and be favored by [[The World/Divine Aspects/Ignomer\|Ignomer]], goddess of nature
- 
# Half-folk Species

Humans, embodying the virtue of their patron deity [[Jvesgar\|Jvesgar]], god of pleasure, are uniquely capable of producing offspring with every mortal race (and some non-mortal ones). The half-folk, as these people are called, historically share a close kinship with humans. And likewise, [[Jvesgar\|Jvesgar]] acts as the patron deity for any mortal race sharing human blood—and though the Dragonborn have their own deity, [[Jvesgar\|Jvesgar]] is said to view them with the same affection as all other half-folk. All half-folk are relatively uncommon, but their presence is still felt throughout [[The World/Dor'Balar\|Dor'Balar]].
## [[Mortal Races/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]]

- Created in the [[The Ages/Second Age\|Second Age]] by the [[Draconic Dynasty\|Draconic Dynasty]].
- Patron deity of [[The World/Divine Aspects/Strozkus\|Strozkus]], God of the Stars.
	- Strozkus was originally the patron deity of dragons, but sided with the mortal races in the [[Syrillian Alliance\|Syrillian Alliance]].
- Naming conventions: Either draconic with a lot of rough consonants, or similar to human eastern-European names or other human names. E.g., [[Cities and Towns/Jkaverstelle/Pavarax's Frosthold/Pavarax's Frosthold\|Pavarax]], [[The World/Divine Aspects/Stravalli\|Stravalli]].
## [[Mortal Races/Goliaths\|Goliaths]]

- Created in the [[The Ages/Second Age\|Second Age]] by the [[Kingdom of Giants\|Kingdom of Giants]] as half-human half-giant.
## [[Half-Elves\|Half-Elves]]

- Complicated feelings toward Elf history and the [[Nations/Linthirian Empire\|Linthirian Empire]].
- In the [[The Ages/Current Age\|Current Age]], the only way Elves are able to reproduce is by creating Half-Elves with either Human or Half-Elf partners.
## [[Tieflings\|Tieflings]]

- The result of a Human-Demon pairing.
- A lot of stigma against them, especially now as cult activity is rising and anxieties around [[The World/Dor'Daedeloth\|Dor'Daedeloth]] grow.
- Even compared to the other half-folk, Tieflings are uncommon.
