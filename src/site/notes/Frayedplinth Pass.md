# Basic Information

[[Frayedplinth Pass\|Frayedplinth Pass]] is a narrow mountain pass in the [[Amfrey Northmarch\|Amfrey Northmarch]] connecting [[Nations/Jkaverstelle\|Jkaverstelle]] and [[Nations/Anbuur\|Anbuur]]. In recent years, this border area gained national attention as a small platooon of [[Nations/Anbuur\|Anbuuri]] soldiers attempted to take the fortified [[Nations/Jkaverstelle\|Jkaverstelle]] keep at the pass' southern exit. Thankfully however, due to the bravery and skill of a small number of [[Cities and Towns/Jkaverstelle/Pavarax's Frosthold/Knightly Order of the World Tree\|Knights of the World Tree]] sent to investigate the area, they alone were able to fend off the invading force for three full days until allied [[Nations/Jkaverstelle\|Jkaverstelle]] armies arrived. 

The Order Knights responsible for this defense have been heralded as heroes. In particular, one individual known as [[Players/Knight Eden\|Knight Eden]] stood out even among her peers, having single-handedly defended the Pass and her fallen allies in the final hours of the assault.
