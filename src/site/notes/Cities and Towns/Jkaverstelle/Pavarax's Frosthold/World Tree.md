> “I swear, every year the potions get less effective, and every year more people decide that means we’re keeping them from the ‘good stuff’. We authorize exactly as much tapping as the Tree can handle helpfully, if we say no that means there’s nothing else to take! You aren’t going to cure your grandma’s dementia through unacceptable harvesting! And I swear, the next hooligans I catch trying to drink straight sap, I’m going to drown them in the stuff, see how healing it is then.”

In addition, the magical sap of the [[Cities and Towns/Jkaverstelle/Pavarax's Frosthold/World Tree\|World Tree]]—when ritualistically tapped—can be used as a powerful reagent to create health potions; though due to over-harvesting in ages past, the potency of this sap has become diminished in the [[The Ages/Current Age\|Current Age]].
