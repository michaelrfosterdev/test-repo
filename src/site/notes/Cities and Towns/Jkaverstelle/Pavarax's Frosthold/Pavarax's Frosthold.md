> “While the Stravalli Highduchy as a whole is cold and inhospitable, its hardy folk have forged many oases of warmth and comfort upon its high cliff faces. Chief among them is the capital, [[Cities and Towns/Jkaverstelle/Pavarax's Frosthold/Pavarax's Frosthold\|Pavarax's Frosthold]]. True to its name, frost is held at bay just past the city’s walls, and the balmy weather within feels like the first breath of summer, even as snow falls just outside the gates.

# History

In the [[The Ages/Second Age\|Second Age]], the mountainous region of south-west [[The World/Dor'Balar\|Dor'Balar]] was controlled by the tyrannical red dragon [[Xogarrim of the Earth\|Xogarrim of the Earth]] who used powerful earthquakes to dominate the [[Mortal Races/Mortal Races\|mortal races]] of his domain. According to legends, as mortal anguish peaked under draconic rule in the [[The Ages/Second Age\|Second Age]], [[The World/Divine Aspects/Ignomer\|Ignomer]] himself planted the World Tree's sapling as a boon to the [[Mortal Races/Mortal Races\|mortal races]]. Offering respite from [[Xogarrim of the Earth\|Xogarrim's]] tremors, warmth under its branches, an healing from its sap, mortals of the [[Syrillian Alliance\|Syrillian Alliance]] established a stronghold under the World Tree to strike against their overlords. Named after the famed Syrillian revolutionary [[Stravalli\|Pavarax Stravalli]], a dragonborn instrumental in toppling [[Xogarrim of the Earth\|Xogarrim's]] regime, [[Cities and Towns/Jkaverstelle/Pavarax's Frosthold/Pavarax's Frosthold\|Pavarax's Frosthold]] continued to act as a sanctuary for mortal races through the [[The Ages/Third Age\|Third]] and [[The Ages/Current Age\|Current]] Ages.  

But despite the great power of the [[Cities and Towns/Jkaverstelle/Pavarax's Frosthold/World Tree\|World Tree]], like nature herself, it must be protected and nurtured. As was discovered in the aftermath of the [[Syrillian Alliance\|Syrillian Alliance]] in the [[The Ages/Third Age\|Third Age]], over-tapping of the Tree's valuable sap led to its steadily declining health. To defend the tree and manage its resources, the [[Cities and Towns/Jkaverstelle/Pavarax's Frosthold/Knightly Order of the World Tree\|Knightly Order of the World Tree]] was founded, ensuring that the limited resources the Tree produced were distributed fairly and without killing the Tree itself. 

In the [[The Ages/Third Age\|Third Age]], [[Cities and Towns/Jkaverstelle/Pavarax's Frosthold/Pavarax's Frosthold\|Pavarax's Frosthold]] once again acted as a stronghold for the oppressed. Located a continent-length away from [[Cities and Towns/Linthir'Aprimos\|Linthir'Aprimos]] and in the defensible mountain-tops, this city acted as a key bastion of safety for those rebelling against [[Elven\|Elven]] cruelty.

In the [[The Ages/Current Age\|Current Age]], House [[Stravalli\|Stravalli]] reigns as lord over this city and the surrounding lands, having joined [[Cities and Towns/Jkaverstelle/Kithraia/Kithraia\|Kithraia]] early in the [[The World/Brief History of Dor'Balar\|Fractured States Period]] as a vassal state poised against [[Cities and Towns/Anbuur/Khazâddun\|Khazâddun]] aggression.
