> "Promise me you'll visit for the New Year? Picture this, the spice of mulled wine in the air, the sounds of bards spinning tales in every tavern, the warmth of the crowd as we wander the snowy [[Cities and Towns/Jkaverstelle/Kithraia/Kithraia\|Kithraian]] streets. And the lights they put up in the [[Royal Strömborg\|Strömborg]]! It's as though [[The World/Divine Aspects/Strozkus\|Strozkus]] himself arranged the stars in our halls! All peoples from all walks of life, rubbing elbows and enjoying the best our world has to offer. I know you have that [[Cities and Towns/Jkaverstelle/Pavarax's Frosthold/World Tree\|tree]] to keep you warm, but I swear you'll freeze your scales off if you don't come back down to earth before the weather turns. You'll at least think about it, won't you?"
