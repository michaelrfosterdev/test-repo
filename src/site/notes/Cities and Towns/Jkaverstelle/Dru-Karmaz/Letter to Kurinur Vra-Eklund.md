> Dear [[Kurinur Vra-Eklund\|Kurinur]],
> 
> Your last letter made my year! When I heard that little [[Gruntor\|Gruntor]] was born safe and healthy, [[Bronson\|Bronson]] swears I was a man possessed; I ran through the streets telling anyone who would listen that their sheriff was an uncle to the most perfect baby boy. Ever since I heard the news, I've been trying to make time to visit you in the city, but I swear the Divines conspire against me. First the trouble at the mill, then [[Guiles\|Guiles]] causing his usual trouble at the Maid, and now I'm hearing reports of figures in the woods by the townsfolk! That last point's the worst of it; all this talk of cults from the north has these people spooked, I've even heard whispers that a "demon" stalks the town. It's autumn. The bears are massive this time of year. And why would any cult be interested in our sleepy town? 
> 
> Still, if it'll calm the citizens, I'll perform a sweep of the woods in search of their "demon" before leaving for [[Cities and Towns/Jkaverstelle/Kithraia/Kithraia\|Kithraia]]. And I swear, if [[Guiles\|Guiles]] stirs up any more trouble, I'm dumping the paperwork on Deputy [[Bronson\|Bronson]]. I love you, and I'll see you soon.

> With love,
> [[Urthgar Vra-Eklund\|Urthgar]]

> P.S. I'm bringing a gift for the little one! I'm no carpenter, but I think I did a decent job all things considered.
