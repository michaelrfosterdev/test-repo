# Basic Info

[[Cities and Towns/Jkaverstelle/Dru-Karmaz/Dru-Karmaz\|Dru-Karmaz]] is a small arboreal town in the [[Morkay Timberlands\|Morkay Timberlands]] in [[Nations/Jkaverstelle\|Jkaverstelle's]] south-eastern [[Rohitah Southmarch\|Rohitah Southmarch]]. [[Cities and Towns/Jkaverstelle/Dru-Karmaz/Dru-Karmaz\|Dru-Karmaz]] has ~200 permanent residents made up primarily of Humans and Orcs. Despite being in the [[Rohitah Southmarch\|Rohitah Southmarch]], the economy of [[Cities and Towns/Jkaverstelle/Dru-Karmaz/Dru-Karmaz\|Dru-Karmaz]] is heavily reliant on the lucrative [[Amfrey\|Amfrey]] Lumber Company, managed by the local lumber baron [[First Adventure/Landers Amfrey\|Landers Amfrey]] of House [[Amfrey\|Amfrey]]. As such, House [[Amfrey\|Amfrey]] and Landers specifically have significant sway in local politics.

Running north-to-south through the center of town is the [[Kuku-Lum\|Kuku-Lum]] river, originating in the northern [[Golden Highlands\|Golden Highlands]], emptying in lake [[Kuku-Karmaz\|Kuku-Karmaz]] south of town, and powering the local lumber mill crucial to the town's economy.

# Geography

Dru-Karmaz is a town near the south-east border of [[Nations/Jkaverstelle\|Jkaverstelle]] in the [[Rohitah Southmarch\|Rohitah Southmarch]]. It's surrounded on all sides by woods with the [[Kuku-Lum\|Kuku-Lum]] river bisecting the town, flowing south for 30 minutes before depositing into lake [[Kuku-Karmaz\|Kuku-Karmaz]]. The local lumber baron [[First Adventure/Landers Amfrey\|Landers Amfrey]] lives in an isolated manor 20 minutes south-west of the town. 
# Economy

This town relies heavily on the large amounts of lumber it exports to central [[Nations/Jkaverstelle\|Jkaverstelle]]. Roughly 30% of the town's population works under the [[First Adventure/Landers Amfrey\|Amfrey Lumber Company]] as loggers, millhands, surveyors, and carpenters. Even though the largely mountainous nation of [[Nations/Anbuur\|Anbuur]] would love to patron the lumber of [[Cities and Towns/Jkaverstelle/Dru-Karmaz/Dru-Karmaz\|Dru-Karmaz]], heavy taxes from [[Nations/Jkaverstelle\|Jkaverstelle]] make trade to Anbuuri clients mostly unprofitable.  

Aside from lumber, there are a number of other locations of interest in town:

a) The Drowsy Maid
b) Grotuk's Meats
c) [[Amfrey\|Amfrey]] Mill
d) [[The World/Divine Aspects\|Ignomer]]'s Parish
e) Common Sundries
f) [[Mortal Races/Humans\|Hjsveli]] Iron
